# Exercise 1: Load Balancing and Model Routing 

### Eestimated Duration: Minutes

## Lab Overview

In this exercise, you will learn how to efficiently distribute AI requests across multiple Azure OpenAI (AOAI) backends to ensure high availability and balanced traffic, route requests to the appropriate AI models based on user or application requirements, and implement session affinity to maintain consistent, coherent responses for multi-turn interactions with AI agents. This will give you practical experience in managing scalable, reliable, and context-aware AI deployments.

By the end, you will visualize how APIM intelligently distributes load across AI services for optimal performance and resilience.

## Lab Objectives

- Task 1: Configure load balancing across AOAI resource pools

- Task 2: Set up model routing for directing requests to different models

- Task 3: Implement session affinity to keep responses consistent for agent interactions

## Task 1: Configure load balancing across AOAI resource pools

In this task, you will learn how to distribute incoming AI requests across multiple Azure OpenAI (AOAI) endpoints deployed in different regions. You will configure Azure API Management (APIM) to intelligently route traffic, ensuring high availability, efficient utilization of resources, and seamless failover when one endpoint reaches capacity or becomes unavailable.

1. Go back to the VS Code terminal and press **Enter** to choose the default subscription.

   ![](./media/e1t1p7(4).png)

9. Go to **1Ô∏è‚É£ Verify the Azure CLI and the connected Azure subscription**. Click on **Run**, in this session, we check that the Azure CLI is installed, up-to-date, and connected to your subscription. This ensures we can deploy and manage resources in your Azure account. Review the output.

10. In the **2Ô∏è‚É£ Create deployment using ü¶æ Bicep**. Here, we use Bicep to define and deploy all necessary Azure resources, including the AI endpoints and APIM service. Running this sets up the infrastructure needed for the lab.

     ![](./media/e1t1p17(1).png)
    
12. **3Ô∏è‚É£ Get the deployment outputs**. This session retrieves key information from the deployment, such as API URLs, subscription keys, and resource IDs. We use these outputs to connect and test the AI endpoints in later steps.

    ![](./media/e1t1p15.png)
    
14. **üß™ Test the API using the Azure OpenAI Python SDK**. Finally, we test the deployed AI endpoints using the Python SDK to send requests, check responses, and observe which backend region served each request. This demonstrates load balancing and routing in action.

      ![](./media/e1t1p18.png)

15. **üîç Analyze Load Balancing results**. In this session, we analyze the load balancing results to see how traffic is distributed across the AI endpoints. The priority 1 backend handles requests first, and once it reaches its limit, traffic is shared between the two priority 2 backends.

## Task 2: Set up model routing for directing requests to different models

This task focuses on directing requests to specific AI models based on parameters such as model type or workload. You will configure APIM to route each request to the correct backend AI model and test the responses, gaining an understanding of how model routing can optimize performance, resource usage, and cost efficiency.

1. In Visual Studio Code, from the left navigation pane, select **Explorer**, then expand **model-routing (1)** click on **model-routing.ipynb (2)**.

   ![](./media/e1t2p1.png)

1. Run the cell **0Ô∏è‚É£ Initialize Notebook Variables**. Sets up all deployment variables, model configs, APIM settings, and inference API info. At the end, all parameters are ready in memory, no resources are created yet.

   ![](./media/e1t2p3.png)

2. Run the cell **1Ô∏è‚É£ Verify Azure CLI and Subscription**. Checks that Azure CLI is connected and retrieves current user, tenant, and subscription info.
At the end, you know the deployment will run in the correct subscription.

   ![](./media/e1t2p4.png)
   
4. Run the cell **2Ô∏è‚É£ Create Deployment using Bicep**. Creates the resource group if needed, writes params.json, and deploys resources using Bicep.
At the end, APIM, AI services, and model routing are provisioned (or an error is returned).

   ![](./media/API-gateway-image19.png)
   
6. Run the cell **3Ô∏è‚É£ Get Deployment Outputs**. Fetches outputs like APIM URLs, subscription keys, and workspace IDs from the deployment.
At the end, all resource identifiers and API keys are available for testing the deployed services.

    ![](./media/API-gateway-image20.png)
   
8. Run the cell **üß™ Test the API using Azure OpenAI Python SDK**. Connects to APIM and sends messages to multiple models to verify routing and responses.

    ![](./media/API-gateway-image21.png)

   >**Note**: At the end, model responses and backend regions are printed to confirm deployment and load balancing.

1. In the **Clean up resources** cell, click on **clean-up-resources notebook**.

## Task 3: Implement session affinity to keep responses consistent for agent interactions (In Progress)

> Session Affinity, also known as sticky sessions, is a technique used in load-balanced systems to ensure that all requests from a specific user or session are consistently routed to the same backend server or model instance.
